I want this app to be able to list out the latest knitting patterns from Yarnspirations.com. User should be able to ask for more information about them by selecting a number.

User should be able to see the list of patterns 12 at a time with a short name and description, then user selects the number of the one they want to see and the full description of the knitting pattern would be output on the screen.

Example:

User types in knitting-cli at the command line prompt
